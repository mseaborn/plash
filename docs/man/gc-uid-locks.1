.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
gc\-uid\-locks \-\-gc

.SH DESCRIPTION
gc\-uid\-locks garbage collects the lock files that are used for
reserving user IDs. The lock files it removes are those created by
run\-as\-anonymous, which assigns each process it starts a different
UID.

gc\-uid\-locks works by scanning \fB/proc\fR to see what
processes are running, and what user IDs they are running under.
.PP
The Plash shell runs gc\-uid\-locks when it starts up. It may turn out
to be desirable to run gc\-uid\-locks more often than this.
.PP
gc\-uid\-locks is a setuid root program. It is one of the small parts
of Plash that requires root access to install.
