This is for creating a Debian package to contain the glibc source
code, so that the Plash source package does not have to include the
glibc source directory.

Unfortunately, the Debian packaging system does not provide a way for
one source package to use data from another unless it is built into a
binary (*.deb) package.

So what we do is rather round-the-houses:
The source here builds a Debian source package...
which builds a Debian binary package (containing only the glibc source)...
which is used by the Plash source package to build the Plash binary package.
