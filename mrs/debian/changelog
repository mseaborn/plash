plash (1.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Implemented FD redirection in the shell.
  * Implemented rename() and link() for the same-directory case.
    (The cross-directory case is trickier, 1. because it's hard to do
    under Unix without race conditions in the presence of symlinks, and
    2. it's complicated by directory proxy objects.)
  * Improved one-line logging in the server.  Every call to the server
    now produces a log line (though some are not fully filled out).
  * Implemented bind().
  * Implemented symlink() and utime()/utimes().
  * Changed getuid() and getgid() so that they can take the uid/gid from
    the environment variables PLASH_FAKE_UID/GID.  Some programs cannot
    cope when they have a uid that does not have an entry in /etc/passwd.
  * Added run-as-anonymous.
  * Implemented globbing in the shell.  Pathnames now have structure in
    the grammar; their components are separated by the parser.
    When a pathname doesn't contain any wildcards, it is converted back
    into a string.  It is canonicalised in the process; duplicate '/'s
    are collapsed.
  * Fixed FD leak:  the fabricated directory structure is now freed.

plash (1.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added support for `#!' scripts (to both the shell and the server).
  * Add the ability to run programs conventionally with the `!!' prefix.
  * Add pipes.
  * Fix bug in server that caused it to ignore processes when there are
    multiple processes.
  * Added options window that can be used to turn debugging output on.
    Can be opened using the "opts" command.
  * Build libpthread.so so that it doesn't contain filesystem syscalls.
    The relevant functions are now forwarded to libc.so.
  * Remove glibc's io/open64.os from the link.  This includes a syscall,
    but didn't in an earlier glibc.  This is a rather embarrassing bug
    because it shows I didn't do much testing -- even cat uses open64().
