plash (1.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added support for `#!' scripts (to both the shell and the server).
  * Add the ability to run programs conventionally with the `!!' prefix.
  * Add pipes.
  * Fix bug in server that caused it to ignore processes when there are
    multiple processes.
  * Added options window that can be used to turn debugging output on.
    Can be opened using the "opts" command.
  * Build libpthread.so so that it doesn't contain filesystem syscalls.
    The relevant functions are now forwarded to libc.so.
  * Remove glibc's io/open64.os from the link.  This includes a syscall,
    but didn't in an earlier glibc.  This is a rather embarrassing bug
    because it shows I didn't do much testing -- even cat uses open64().
